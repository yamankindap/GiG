## Point process simulation of Generalised inverse-Gaussian processes

The implementation of the methodology introduced in __Point process simulation of Generalised inverse Gaussian processes and estimation of the Jaeger Integral__ by Simon Godsill and Yaman Kındap is provided.

The generalised inverse-Gaussian (GIG) Levy density is a function of the parameters λ, γ and δ. These parameters can be set inside the process and random variable simulation scripts for various different parameter settings.
